Thank You
---------

We want to start by thanking every single individual who showed
interest, participated, listened, and came along with us in the early
stages of our work. We recognize that the process and progress weren't
perfect, but it 100% would not have been possible if it weren't for you.
CHAI is at its core, a convener, and a member-driven non-profit. We are
so grateful to be on this journey with you towards responsible AI in
health for all. Your experiences, your feedback, your contributions, all
make us who we are and help bring us to where we need to be.

For those who want to be credited directly by name please reach out to
us at admin@chai.org to request contribution credit for the workgroup
that you participated in. You can also email to request changes to the
list. Below is a list of individuals who consented to be named for their
contributions, and organizations who had at least one (many times more)
individuals who showed interest and/or participated in our Predictive AI
sepsis risk prediction work group.
